Omega, for example, is owned by a Swiss watch manufacturer called [The Swatch Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swatch_Group). Under this group's umbrellas there are several other watch brands. Another is the [Richemont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richemont) company, which owns several others, mostly high-end luxury brands.
