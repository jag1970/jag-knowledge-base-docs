# Dive watches

## Highlights

A dive watch is considered a tool primarily used for diving. Not only does it maintain its primary purpose as a timepiece used to tell time, but it also contains specific [[sub-category-02 | functionality]] to be used for recreational and professional diving. Â They are designed to be waterproof and resistant to the pressure of diving to great depths. These types of watches are the most [[sub-category-05| popular]] due to their robust nature and are among the top sellers among the most prevalent watch [[sub-category-04|brands]]. The [[sub-category-02 | history]] of dive watches is relatively new compared to timepieces themselves, but they began to gain popularity during the 1960s and were also made popular due to product placement in popular movies.
