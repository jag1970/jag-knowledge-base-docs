# What makes it a [[category-01/sub-category-01|dive]] watch?

## Features of a dive watch

* Waterproof
* Rotating Bezel
* Screw down crown
* Luminescence

### Waterproof

It goes without saying that a watch used for diving should be waterproof. Though many watches do have a measure of withstanding water ingress, watches used for professional diving should have a minimum of 200 meters.  This means that you should be able to dive to that depth with water entering the watch.

### Rotating Bezel

Rotating bezels are used to time a person's dive. They are on top of the  watch and are capable of being manual rotated to the minute hand and graduated in minutes, you are able to determine how long you have been under water. This does not take the place of a diving computer but is used to compliment it when diving.

### Screw down crown

Another vulnerability for water ingress into a watch is at the crown. The crown, especially on mechanical watches, is used to wind the watch to give it its power. It is also used to set the time and change the day and date if it happens to have this complication. To prevent water from entering a watch when diving, the crown has the ability to be screw down and tightened, and usually will have tiny gaskets to help from water intrusion. 

### Luminescence

Luminescence, or what most enthusiasts call "Lume", is popular on dive watches for its ability to light dive watch hands and markers. This helps when diving because a diver is able to read is watch easier, especially in darker environments. This luminous material gets its brightness from exposure of ultra violent rays and can last minutes to hours in complete darkness.
