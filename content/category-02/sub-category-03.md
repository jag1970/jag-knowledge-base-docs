# What makes it a [[category-02/sub-category-01|chronograph]] ?

The primary feature of a chronograph is the ability to record elapsed time so all of them much have a built in stop watch technically. Although some could also include the features of a [[category-01/sub-category-03|dive watch]] they would still be classified as such however, with a chronograph feature. Most commonly, but not always, a chronograph will features a tachymeter use to measure speed and distance. Another feature is the number of sub-dials on a chronograph used to measure hours, minutes, seconds and even tenths of a second.
