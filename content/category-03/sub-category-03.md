# What the heck does GMT mean anyway?

"GMT" stands for Greenwich Mean Time. For a full understanding of what this exactly is clear [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time) for more information. To put it simply, its where all time zones begin and end and is used as a starting point for all other time zones. To be classified as a GMT watch, a watch usually has an extra hand or GMT hand that will reference a 24 HR bezel. Sometimes a watch can have this internally however the majority of the time it is a external bezel. You can move either the hand or the bezel to easily read a second time zone. A GMT function is not only on time only watches but can also be included in a [[category-02/sub-category-01|chronograph]], [[category-01/sub-category-01|diver]] and even a dress watch.
