If you just wanted a no frills, just tell me the time and something that can be worn in just about any situation then you would probably be recommended a field watch. Sometimes references as a "GADA" watch which mean go anywhere, do anything. It it mean to be rugged and withstand normal day to day activity. It is minimal in design, small and usually just tells the time, however in some case it might have a date [[category-04/sub-category-03|function]].
