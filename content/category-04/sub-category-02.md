### Brief History of the Field Watch

The field watch didn't come to exist due to popular trends but rather out of necessity and [[category-04/sub-category-03|function]].
During WWII soldiers in the field found it a valuable piece of equipment. They used these simple, time only watches to sync each others times when on missions. Because of this, it had to be something rugged with the ability to hack or stop the time to a second so everyone could on those missions could be all on the same time. The standard for this was the A-11 military issue watch and was manufactured by several companies. (see below) Since then however, there are more for individuals wanting a military inspired rugged watch.
